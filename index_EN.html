    <p class="intro__text">
      According to VTsIOM polls, while 95% of Russians dream of traveling
      abroad, only 36% plan to spend their vacation in their own country. Yet,
      Russia is a diverse and breathtaking universe, encompassing the gentle
      seas of the south, the dense forests of Sayan, and the harsh ice of the
      Putorana Plateau. The best part? You don't need to have millions in your
      bank account, a passport, or endure long flights to experience these
      natural wonders. Take inspiration from Vera Bashmakova, a brave young
      mother who took her three children on a 20,000-kilometer road trip across
      her native country in her trusty Lada car. </p>

          <p class="place__paragraph">The Curonian Spit is a stunning natural
                                      area located in the Kaliningrad Oblast,
                                      where you can witness two contrasting
                                      water horizons. To one side lies the
                                      peaceful Curonian Lagoon, while on the
                                      other, the Baltic Sea ripples with waves.
                                      The unique landscape of forests and sandy
                                      dunes makes it a must-visit destination in
                                      Russia.</p>
          <p class="place__paragraph">But the Kaliningrad Oblast has more to
                                      offer. Nearby is the westernmost point of
                                      Russia - the Baltic Spit - and a
                                      collection of small coastal towns that
                                      reflect their German heritage. The
                                      atmosphere of these places is calm and
                                      peaceful, perfect for visitors seeking a
                                      break from the hustle and bustle of city
                                      life. Immersing yourself in the
                                      tranquility of nature and breathing in the
                                      refreshing scent of the cool sea breeze is
                                      an experience you won't forget.</p>

          <p class="place__paragraph">Altai is undoubtedly one of the most
                                      beautiful places in Russia, thanks to its
                                      majestic mountains, lush pine forests,
                                      pristine rivers and lakes. As you travel
                                      along the Altai mountain range, you'll be
                                      greeted by breathtaking views of towering
                                      peaks and winding valleys, with fragrant
                                      pine trees dotting the landscape. Opening
                                      the car windows, you'll be hit by the
                                      invigorating mountain air, a true wonder
                                      of this region.</p>
          <p class="place__paragraph">The Altai climate is moderate, making
                                      summer the best time to visit if you want
                                      to experience the full range of local
                                      flora and fauna. Here, you'll encounter a
                                      wide variety of wildlife, such as elk
                                      roaming through the forests, eagles
                                      soaring above the peaks, and deer grazing
                                      on the plains. You might even catch a
                                      glimpse of the famous manuls, who call the
                                      Altai region their home.</p>

          <p class="place__paragraph">Winter at Lake Baikal is truly a sight to
                                      behold. Known as the largest freshwater
                                      lake in the world, Baikal is also one of
                                      the most stunning destinations in Russia.
                                      But there's more to Baikal than meets the
                                      eye. It's also an ideal location for
                                      ski-joring competitions.</p>
          <p class="place__paragraph">For those unfamiliar with the sport,
                                      ski-joring involves a skier being tethered
                                      to a motorbike, with the pair aiming to
                                      reach high speeds across the ice. In March
                                      2019, the "Baikal Mile" festival set a new
                                      world record for ski-joring, with a top
                                      speed of 197.011 km/h. This festival is
                                      just one example of the many unique events
                                      and activities that take place at Lake
                                      Baikal, making it an unforgettable
                                      destination for visitors from around the
                                      globe.</p>

                                      Ural Mountains, but in reality, it extends
                                      into Karelia. The Siberian larch, which
                                      forms the taiga, does not grow west of
                                      Lake Vodlozero, but in Karelian national
                                      parks, it reaches heights of up to 30
                                      meters. These forests have never known the
                                      sound of an ax due to the impenetrable
                                      swamps that surround them. Some of the
                                      pines here are over five hundred years
                                      old, having witnessed the sun long before

                                      single trail in the virgin forest for
                                      hundreds of kilometers. And on the rare
                                      paths that do exist, trees a few meters
                                      off the ground are marked with bear claws
                                      to let everyone know who is in charge
                                      here.</p>
