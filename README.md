The **"Traveling Across Russia"** project is part of a web development course at Yandex.Practicum. The goal of the project is to practice and master adaptive web design techniques by creating a static webpage.

The webpage is designed to showcase the beauty and diversity of Russia through travel experiences. It includes various sections, such as destinations, travel tips, and cultural insights, that provide users with valuable information about planning a trip to Russia.

To achieve an optimal user experience across different devices, the webpage uses:

CSS
- CSS Flexbox and Gridlayout for building a responsive grid;
- relative sizing units and CSS functions for creating flexible blocks;
- media queries are employed to ensure that the page adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes.

HTML
- To improve the accessibility of the page, a variety of semantic HTML tags are used to structure and organize the content.

Moreover, the CSS files are structured using the BEM methodology for better maintainability and scalability.
